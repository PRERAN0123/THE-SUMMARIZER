- Image to text: use this feature to extract text from images, the AI model can detect various other languages like hindi, kannada, tamil and telegu
  
- Audio to text: use this feature to extract text from audio, the model currently accepts only mp3 formats, please wait for a while for the text to display as the AI takes time to listen to the audio and extract text
  
- Video to text: use this to extract text from video sources, the AI can detect the text written in a video and display the output as text

- YouTube to text: this feature takes the audio from Youtube videos and extract text, as of now, the AI can handle short length videos, this is similar to audio to text but you do not need a mp3 file downloaded

- PDF to text: this feature extracts text from PDF (does not include texts from images/tables in PDFs as of now), the text is given in chunks to break down the long texts into shorter bits for faster performance, it is reccomended to give short PDFs as of now as larger PDFs crash the feature

- Summarize Text: this is the main feature of this website, to summarize text, just copy the text extracted from any one of the methods above to the summarize text box, wait for a few seconds to view the AI summary of the text
